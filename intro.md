## HTM

Ordered list of useful links to dive into the HTM theory and practice:

- [HTM School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMB0ri4qgwc&list=PL3yXMgtrZmDqhsFQzwUC9V8MeeVOQ7eZ9) youtube playlist
  - 0-12 are required, others - optional
  - important to get used to: SDR concept and feature; concept and high level work of Spatial Pooler (SP) and Temporal Memory (TM)
  - NB: implementation details aren't important at first, no need for grocking them from the start
- [Optional] Short and easy to read [numenta paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07469) on the power of SDR.
- Intro to `htm.core` package Temporal Memory class - two-part blog post series ([part1](https://3rdman.de/2020/02/hierarchical-temporal-memory-part-1-getting-started/), [part2](https://3rdman.de/2020/04/hierarchical-temporal-memory-part-2/)) on how to use it.
  - NB: it's good if you understood high level TM algo and at this point have questions regarding the low level details
- [BAMI.TM](https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/temporal-memory-algorithm/Temporal-Memory-Algorithm-Details.pdf) - definitive guide on Temporal Memory (TM) implementation details
  - very important for understanding HTM - how to use it and its limits

Additional useful links:

- [BAMI.SDR](https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/biological-and-machine-intelligence/BaMI-SDR.pdf) - definitive guide on Sparse Distributed Representations (SDR)
- [BAMI.SP](https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/spatial-pooling-algorithm/Spatial-Pooling-Algorithm-Details.pdf) - definitive guide on Spatial Pooler (SP)
- [Optional] Another [numenta paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11257) on the power of sparse representations applied to mainstream Artificial Neural Networks.
