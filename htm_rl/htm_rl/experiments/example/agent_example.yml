# ========= Agent config =========
# Sets all agent-related config variables.

# Config could be placed where agent config dict is expected:
# 1. separate file prefixed with `agent_`
# 2. in experiment config file in `agents`.

# Declares the type of agent. The type is just a string that helps
# to select an agent constructor. Your scenario should support it.
_type_: dreamer0

# SA encoder config. It can contain dict with the corresponding config
# or it can contain string name of the corresponding config file without
# "sa_encoder_" prefix, (i.e. if filename "sa_encoder_q.yml", use just "q")
# Your agent constructor can support empty config (i.e. =None) like in
# this example. How you will treat it is up to you. In dream_cond scenario
# it's treated as using default CrossSaEncoder, which doesn't have any config params.

# QValueNetwork params.
# NB: some params are set as [x, y]. These params are usually constants, which
# we may want to slightly reduce each episode. So, x - param initial value, y -
