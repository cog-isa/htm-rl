# ========= Environment config =========
# Sets all environment-related config variables.

# Config content may be placed where an env config dictionary is expected:
# 1. in a separate .yml file prefixed with `env_`
# 2. in an experiment config file in `envs` attribute.

# Several first sections are the direct environment initialization args,
# the following declare variable number of optional modules. The order of modules
# declaration is important, e.g. food module makes use of areas/obstacles map
# to restrict the set of available cells.

# Declares the type of the environment. It's unsupported now as we have
# only 1 env type. For the future use.
